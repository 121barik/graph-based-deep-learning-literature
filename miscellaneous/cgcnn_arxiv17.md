summary

- traditional ML methods for materials design require manually constructed feature vectors/complex transformations
- authors construct crystal graphs and use cnns on these graphs to learn material properties
- their method achieves the same accuracy as DFT (ground truth) for some properties of crystals and theor framework is interpretable
